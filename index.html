        <h2>About Me </h2>
         <p>I born and raised in new jersey. I am a very ambitious man there is nothing that stops me from reaching my goals.
             I love challenges and repairing thing. I have been a service technician for heavy machinery for about 10 years. There
             is nothing better to me then fixing something. Especially when you have to come up with a creative idea to get it up and 
             running (I am good at that). I am looking to change job feilds to challenge myself and move with the times.
